# Evaluation excersice in Adalab

### Module 1

#### Description :page_facing_up:

In this excersice we have to reproduce a web page using the concepts we learned in module 1. The tools we can use are _flex_, _grid_, _scss_ and _adalab web starter kit_.

#### Programs :books:

For that excersice I use VS Code, Zeppling and some resources of MDN web_docs.

#### Work Method :computer:

In first place I structured all the HTML, without any styles. When I had a composition I like, beginning to give some styles in descending order. First header, second the main, etc. I made partials for the HMTL sections and wrote the styles in differents Sass files.

#### Impressions :chart_with_upwards_trend:

From the beginning I started to work with many energy because I liked a lot the example. I hope you can see that energy in my code, for that reason I invite you to check it! :fire:
